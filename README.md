# KingNET
A Twitter/4chan-style public message board, written in Java

KingNET should be online, at kingnet.ddns.net

If it isn't, maybe there's a power outage, or I forgot to pay the internet bill, or I got bored and wanted to mess with y'all :P

**Software requirements:**

The JRE of your choice

Apache Tomcat

MySQL or a compatible equivalent (I personally use MariaDB)

**The SQL tables need to be setup as follows:**

table users:
username, passhash, sessionid

table threads:
threadid, title, posts_dir

table bios:
username, bio

**(Hardcoded) SQL credentials for KingNET:**

username: knet

password: knet123

If you dig hard enough through the source code, you can find and edit these values. I know I shouldn't hardcode credentials, but I'm lazy. Go figure :P
